This video shows how you can set up a Toolchain for building STM32 projects under Windows. It is a precursor for the next video in this series that will build onto this to use VSCode to program and debug the same device.

The tools I downloaded in this video:
* [GCC cross compiler](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)
* [Make for Windows](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* [Recent OpenOCD builds](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**GitHub repository tag:** [Toolchain](https://github.com/EmbeddedGeekYT/egSTM32/tree/toolchain)
